# Staking and Yield

Staking is a crucial feature of the Salvium network, allowing token holders to actively participate in supporting the network while earning rewards. This page explains how staking works in Salvium and the yield mechanism associated with it.

## What is Staking in Salvium?

Staking in Salvium is a process where holders can lock their SAL tokens for a specific number of blocks, contributing to network security and stability. In return for this commitment, stakers earn rewards in the form of yield.

## Key Features of Salvium Staking:

1. **Lock Period**:
   * Stakers lock their Salvium (SAL) tokens for 21,600 blocks (approximately 30 days).
   * When they unlock, the initial stake plus yield will be minted in the wallet.

2. **Reward Structure**:
   * The total staking reward is 20% of each block reward.
   * This reward is distributed proportionally among all active stakers.
   * The more SAL you stake, the higher your proportion of the reward.

3. **Yield Distribution**:
   * When the staked coins unlock, stakers receive their proportional share of the yield generated by the network during the staking period.
   * The yield is paid out in Salvium (SAL) tokens.

4. **Supported Platforms**:
   * Staking is exclusively supported within the project's official desktop GUI and CLI wallets.
   * This ensures security and proper integration with the Salvium network.

5. **Tracking Staking Performance**:
   * Stakers can view their staking history and yield amounts in the wallet's transaction history.
   * This feature allows users to track the performance of their staking investments over time.

## How to Start Staking:

1. Download and install the official Salvium desktop GUI or CLI wallet.
2. Ensure you have SAL tokens in your wallet.
3. Navigate to the staking section in your wallet.
4. Choose the amount of SAL you wish to stake and the staking duration.
5. Confirm the staking transaction.

## Monitoring Your Staking Rewards:

* Current block rewards can be viewed within the wallet interface.
* The transaction history in your wallet will show your staking activities and yield payouts.
* Use this information to assess the performance of your staking strategy and make informed decisions about future staking.

## Benefits of Staking in Salvium:

1. **Passive Income**: Earn additional SAL tokens by supporting the network.
2. **Network Security**: Contribute to the overall security and decentralization of the Salvium network.
3. **No Special Hardware**: Unlike mining, staking doesn't require powerful hardware or high energy consumption.
4. **Flexible**: Choose your staking amount and duration based on your preferences.

## Considerations:

* Staked tokens are locked and cannot be transferred or used for transactions during the staking period.
* Rewards may vary based on the total number of stakers and the current block reward.
* Always ensure you're using the official Salvium wallet to protect your assets.

Staking in Salvium offers a way for token holders to actively participate in the network's operations while earning rewards. By aligning the interests of token holders with the network's security and growth, Salvium creates a robust and engaged community of users and supporters.
