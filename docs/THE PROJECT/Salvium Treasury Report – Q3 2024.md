## Treasury Management Strategy

1. Project funds are not yet being fully utilized to avoid putting pressure on the current low-liquidity market.
2. We are considering additional locks of unused funds.
3. Funds are being allocated for future exchange listing budgets.

## Ongoing Allocations

It is expected that future allocation will be split roughly:

* 60% allocated to development
* 20% allocated to partnerships and exchanges
* 20% community and marketing.

## Transparency and Governance

We remain committed to transparent treasury management. All major decisions regarding fund allocation are made with Salvium's long-term sustainability in mind.
