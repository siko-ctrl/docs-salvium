# Project Roadmap

The Salvium project is set to unfold in three major phases, each building upon the last to create a comprehensive, privacy-focused, and compliant blockchain ecosystem. Here's an overview of our development roadmap:

## Phase 1: Launch Salvium

In this initial phase, we introduce the core features of Salvium, demonstrating its enhanced privacy capabilities and laying the groundwork for future developments.

### Key Features:

1. **Staking and Yield Generation**:
   * Users can stake their SAL tokens to earn rewards.
   * This feature fosters a secure and engaged network from the outset.

2. **Refundable Transactions**:
   * A major step towards compliance, especially for a Monero-based chain.
   * Allows recipients to return transactions to the original sender without requesting an address.
   * Enables the return of unauthorized or incorrect transactions.
   * Transaction returns are precise, minus the standard transaction fee.

### Significance:
* Demonstrates Salvium's evolved privacy capabilities.
* Introduces compliance features rarely seen in privacy-focused blockchains.
* Establishes the foundation for a secure and engaged user network.

## Phase 2: Additional Compliance Features

This phase focuses on enhancing Salvium's compliance features, particularly in line with EU's MiCA regulations.

### Key Developments:

* **Advanced Privacy with Compliance**:
  * Users maintain transaction privacy while having the ability to provide authorized entities (e.g., exchanges) with a view key.
  * View keys allow verification of transaction history without compromising overall privacy.

* **Continued Development of Base Technologies**:
  * Commitment to furthering Monero and CryptoNote technologies.
  * Support and contribute to compliance efforts such as:
    * Full chain membership proofs
    * SERAPHIS
    * JAMTIS

### Significance:
* Ensures user privacy while meeting regulatory demands.
* Positions Salvium as a leader in compliant privacy coins.
* Contributes to the broader development of privacy-focused blockchain technologies.

## Phase 3: DeFi Support

The final phase expands Salvium's capabilities into the realm of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), leveraging its unique features for advanced financial applications.

### Key Innovations:

1. **Smart Contract Functionality**:
   * Utilizes the protocol_tx innovation to enable smart contracts.
   * Allows for complex DeFi applications to operate securely and privately on the Salvium network.

2. **Private Token Issuance**:
   * Enables the creation of privacy-preserving tokens within the Salvium ecosystem.

3. **Middleware for Solidity**:
   * Develops middleware to support DApps written in Solidity (Ethereum's primary language).
   * Simplifies the transition of existing Ethereum projects to Salvium.
   * Lowers the entry barrier for developers, encouraging wider adoption.

### Significance:
* Expands Salvium's utility into the rapidly growing DeFi sector.
* Provides a unique platform for privacy-focused DeFi applications.
* Encourages broader adoption by simplifying the development process for Ethereum developers.

## Conclusion

This roadmap outlines Salvium's journey from a privacy-focused blockchain to a comprehensive ecosystem supporting compliant, private DeFi applications. Each phase builds upon the last, creating a platform that balances privacy, compliance, and advanced functionality.
