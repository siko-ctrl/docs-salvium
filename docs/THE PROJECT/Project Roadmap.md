# Project Roadmap

The Salvium project roadmap outlines our planned development milestones and future objectives. This roadmap is dynamic and may be adjusted based on technological advances, market conditions, and community feedback.

## Phase 1: Launch Salvium

### Staking and Yield Generation
- Users can stake their SAL tokens to earn a share of block rewards
- Staking mechanism fosters a secure and engaged network
- Yield generation supports network participation and long-term growth

### Compliance
- Implementation of refundable transactions
- Recipients can return unauthorized or incorrect funds to senders (minus standard transaction fee)
- No separate address request required for refunds
- First significant regulatory compliance step for a Monero-based chain

## Phase 2: Enhancing Compliance Features

### Private Blockchain with Compliance Capabilities
- Evolution to meet stringent regulatory requirements, particularly EU's MiCA regulations
- Preservation of [transaction privacy](../THE PROTOCOL/About Privacy.md) for users
- Authorized entities (e.g., exchanges) can access [view keys](../THE PROTOCOL/Protocol_tx.md) to verify transaction history
- Balance between privacy protection and [regulatory compliance](Compliance Statement.md)

### Advanced Technologies
- Commitment to advancing [Monero and Cryptonote technologies](../THE PROTOCOL/About Privacy.md)
- Integration of compliance-friendly innovations:
  - Full Chain Membership Proofs
  - CARROT implementation where applicable
  - Salvium-specific SPARC technology

## Phase 3: DeFi Integration

### Smart Contract Functionality and Private Token Issuance
- Leveraging **protocol_tx** innovations for [smart contract capabilities](../THE PROTOCOL/The Salvium Protocol and Smart Contracts.md)
- Enabling secure and private DeFi applications within the Salvium network
- Supporting private token issuance with privacy guarantees

### Middleware for Solidity Compatibility
- Introduction of middleware for Ethereum compatibility
- Support for DApps written in Solidity to be easily adapted and deployed
- Lowering entry barriers for developers
- Streamlining transition of existing Ethereum-based projects to Salvium

## Phase 4: Ecosystem Growth

### Developer Ecosystem
- Building comprehensive developer tools
- Creating extensive documentation
- Providing support resources
- Enabling creation of privacy-preserving applications on Salvium

### Interoperability
- Expanding Salvium's reach through strategic partnerships
- Implementing cross-chain functionality
- Maintaining core [privacy](../THE PROTOCOL/About Privacy.md) and [compliance](Compliance Statement.md) features
- Fostering ecosystem growth while preserving project fundamentals
