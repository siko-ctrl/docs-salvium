# Funding and Token Allocation

The project is funded by a 12.01% pre-mine, which is partially locked. These funds will be allocated to build and operations. Miners and stakers will earn 88% of the total supply, plus tail emissions.

## Token Allocation Breakdown

### 1. Build - 3.5%

Salvium became a reality in early 2023 thanks to the vision and dedication of its early developers and contributors. 3.53% of the pre-mine will be allocated as incentives for these active team members and suppliers to support the project's launch.

### 2. Operations - 8.48% (locked)

The long-term success and sustainability of the Salvium protocol rely on continuous development and innovation. To support this, 8.48% of the initial supply is set aside for ongoing enhancements, smart contract integration, and new feature implementation through bounty and grant programs. These tokens are time-locked in a governance wallet and released over 24 monthly installments. By the end of this period, the project aims to be self-sustaining, funded by gas fees generated within the ecosystem.

### 3. Block Rewards - 87.99%

The block reward is initially split between stakers (20%) and miners (80%). Once DeFi features are operational, the miners will receive 100% of the block reward, as stakers will receive a share of system fees.
