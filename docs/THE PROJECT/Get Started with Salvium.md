# Get Started with Salvium

This guide will walk you through the essential steps to begin using Salvium, from creating your wallet to acquiring and managing your SAL tokens.

## Step 1: Create a Wallet

Your Salvium wallet is your gateway to the Salvium ecosystem. It allows you to send, receive, and manage your SAL tokens securely.

1. Visit the Download Page: Go to the official Salvium website and navigate to the download page.
2. Choose Your Wallet: Salvium offers two types of wallets:
   * GUI Wallet: A user-friendly, graphical interface ideal for most users, especially beginners.
   * CLI Wallet: A command-line interface wallet for more experienced users who prefer greater control and customization.
3. Download and Install: Select the appropriate wallet for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and follow the installation instructions.
4. Set Up Your Wallet: Open the installed wallet application and follow the prompts to create a new wallet. Be sure to securely store your seed phrase and password.

## Step 2: Buy Salvium

Once you have your wallet set up, you're ready to acquire some SAL tokens.

1. Visit the Exchange Page: Go to the official Salvium exchange page. This page will provide you with a list of exchanges where SAL is available for purchase.
2. Choose an Exchange: Select an exchange that suits your needs. Consider factors such as your location, preferred payment methods, and the exchange's reputation.
3. Create an Account: If you don't already have an account on the chosen exchange, you'll need to create one and complete any required verification processes.
4. Purchase SAL: Once your exchange account is set up and funded, you can proceed to buy SAL tokens. Follow the exchange's specific instructions for purchasing cryptocurrencies.

## Step 3: Transfer Funds to Your Wallet

After acquiring SAL tokens, it's crucial to transfer them to your personal Salvium wallet to ensure you have full custody of your funds.

1. Locate Your Wallet Address: Open your Salvium wallet and find your wallet address. This is a long string of characters that serves as the destination for receiving SAL.
2. Initiate the Transfer: On the exchange where you purchased SAL, navigate to the withdrawal or transfer section. Enter your Salvium wallet address as the destination and specify the amount of SAL you wish to transfer.
3. Confirm the Transaction: Double-check all details before confirming the transfer. Once confirmed, the exchange will process your withdrawal.
4. Wait for Confirmation: Depending on network congestion, it may take a few minutes for the transfer to complete. Your Salvium wallet will notify you once the funds are received.
