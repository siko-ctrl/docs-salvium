# Compliance Statement

Salvium is committed to developing a privacy-centric blockchain that aligns with evolving regulatory standards. This page outlines our approach to compliance and important considerations for users and stakeholders.

## Regulatory Stance

* **No Public Offering**: Salvium (SAL) is not conducting a public offering or Initial Coin Offering (ICO). The initial distribution of SAL tokens occurs primarily through mining.

* **Pre-mine Allocation**: A small portion of the total supply has been pre-mined to support development and operations.

* **Current Regulatory Status**: As Salvium is not making a public offering, it currently does not fall under the scope of EU regulations requiring a crypto-asset white paper for public offerings.

* **Commitment to Best Practices**: While not currently subject to specific regulations, Salvium is committed to maintaining transparency and adhering to best practices in the cryptocurrency space.

## Rights, Obligations, and Governance

### Token Rights:
* SAL miners participate in network consensus through mining.
* Token holders can engage in staking for rewards.
* SAL can be used for transactions within the Salvium ecosystem.

### User Obligations:
* Token holders are obligated to comply with applicable laws and regulations in their jurisdictions.

### Governance Structure:
* Holding SAL tokens does not confer voting rights or direct governance control over the Salvium project.
* The project's development and decision-making processes are open and collaborative, welcoming contributions from the entire Salvium community.
* While a core group of developers may guide certain aspects, the project strives for decentralization in both technology and governance.

## Compliance-Related Risks

Users and stakeholders should be aware of the following compliance-related risks:

### Regulatory Evolution:
* The cryptocurrency regulatory landscape is rapidly changing.
* While Salvium is committed to regulatory compliance, there's no guarantee that all future regulatory requirements can be met.
* Changes in regulations could potentially impact Salvium's operations, the use of SAL tokens, or their value.

### Regulatory Uncertainty:
* New regulations may be introduced that could affect Salvium's legal status or operational model.
* Salvium's interpretation of existing regulations may differ from that of regulatory authorities.
* Despite best efforts, Salvium may not be able to adapt to all regulatory changes promptly.
* Future offerings of Salvium may be subject to different regulatory requirements.

### Technology Risks:
* As with all blockchain projects, there's a risk of undiscovered vulnerabilities in the code or underlying cryptographic principles.

### Market Risks:
* The value of SAL tokens may be volatile and subject to market conditions.

### Adoption Risks:
* The success of Salvium depends on community adoption and development.
