# Audits

## Audit Process

### Regular Audits
* Salvium will undergo independent security audits before each major protocol upgrade.
* These audits are conducted by industry experts to ensure the robustness and security of our system.

### Transparency
* We make all audit reports publicly available for verification.
* This allows our community and stakeholders to review the findings and understand the security measures in place.

### Continuous Improvement
* Ongoing governance discussions incorporate feedback from auditors and the community.
* This process ensures that we continuously improve and enhance the protocol based on expert insights and user experiences.

## Types of Audits

### Pre-prints
* These assess the logical accuracy of our protocol design.
* Pre-prints involve a thorough examination of the mathematical and cryptographic principles underlying Salvium.

### Comprehensive Code Reviews
* These involve a detailed analysis of our codebase.
* Code reviews ensure that the implementation aligns with the design and meets high security standards.

## Launch Audit by Cypher Stack (ongoing)

During launch, we partnered with Cypher Stack, renowned specialists in Monero security. They Their expertise in cryptographic research, development, and consultation has been instrumental in ensuring that Salvium is built on a solid foundation of security and innovation. The first audit is a pre-ptint to confirm the maths logic. Results will be published shortly.
