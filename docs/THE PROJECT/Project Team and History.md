# Project Team and History

Salvium is developed by a team of anonymous experts who bring a wealth of experience from the realms of decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain technology, and applied cryptography. The team's members are pioneers in implementing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction privacy and security.

## History

### Timeline
- **Ideation and Research**: Early 2023
- **Launch**: July 2024

## Project Evolution

Salvium began as a research project focusing on the capabilities of CryptoNote as a foundation for private DeFi. In its early iterations, the team revisited, examined, and prototyped work from established Monero researchers. Of particular interest were aspects related to scalability, extensibility, and multi-chain interoperability.

This process enabled Salvium to consider the regulatory and compliance changes being solidified under MiCA and other regimes worldwide. The resulting insights and future focus of Salvium, based on this extensive research, testing, and prototyping, have positioned the project as a much-needed evolution of Cryptonote and Monero. Unusually for DeFi blockchains, Salvium takes a 'privacy-first' approach from the base layer outwards while maintaining the capability to achieve full MiCA compliance. Phase one of this compliance work, which includes refundable payments and a special 'exchange mode' to support these refunds, will be available at launch.

## Development Progress

Over the past year, as Salvium's initial research was tested and prototyped, advancements such as Conditional Payments (CP), refundable payments, native yield, and staking have been developed. Some of these features will be adopted at launch, while others are prepared for future updates.

## Key Innovations

Salvium now introduces several unique technological advancements over Monero and other CryptoNote-based cryptocurrencies, which will drive future development and form the ecosystem's foundation. Key innovations at launch include Transactional Imbalances (TI) and Asynchronous Transactions (AT), whose combination creates the first true native Cryptonote staking and yield system
